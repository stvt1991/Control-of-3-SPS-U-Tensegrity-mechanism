# Control-of-3-SPS-U-Tensegrity-mechanism
This algorithm is employed for the control of a 3-SPS-U type tensegrity mechanism. This mechanism will be integrated into a bio-inspired piping inspection robot to overcome pipe bends
and junctions. A PID control loop is written to ensure a position control of the tensegrity mechanism to operate within the singularity free workspace.

Controller: BeagleBone black
Motors: Maxon DC-Motor with a planetary gearhead (1621:1) controlled by ESCON servo controllers
Trajectories: Linear and Circular path
